<h1 class="heading-one mb-9 mt-0 break-words text-left">What are Linux signals?</h1>
<div class="markdownViewer select-text  markdown-default markdown-table markdown-viewer markdown-viewer-heading" role="none"><p>A <strong>signal</strong> is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition.  Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action.</p>
<p>A signal is just like an interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.</p>
<p>There are two types of signals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maskable</strong>: signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C).</li>
<li><strong>Non-Maskable</strong>: signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Signals List</h2>
<p>The table below contains some common signals and their associated meanings.</p>
